title: Loan Originator API introduction
---
The **Lendermarket Loan Originator API** is a RESTful service designed to allow Loan Originators to manage the full lifecycle of their loan assets on the Lendermarket platform. This interface enables to programmatically create, extend, and buy back loans, as well as record payments and retrieve real-time loan status.

### Core Capabilities

- **Loan Lifecycle Management:** Seamlessly create new loans for various client types (Consumer or Business) and manage maturity dates via the extension endpoint.

- **Transaction Processing:** Initiate buyback requests and report loan payments. Payments are automatically distributed according to a predefined priority: `DELAYED_INTEREST`, `INTEREST`, and then `PRINCIPAL`.

- **Data Retrieval:** Access detailed information on any loan, including remaining principal, invested amounts, and the full payment schedule, using its unique UUID.

### Security and Protocol

To ensure data integrity and security, all requests must be authorized using **Bearer Authentication**. The API communicates exclusively in **JSON format** for both requests and responses.

### Environment URLs

Lendermarket provides two distinct environments for integration and live operations:

- **TEST (Staging):** `https://api.lendermarket.dev/claims/v1/lender/`

- **PROD (Production):** `https://api.lendermarket.com/claims/v1/lender/`
