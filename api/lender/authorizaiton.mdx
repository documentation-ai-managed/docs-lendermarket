Security is handled through a combination of credential validation and network restrictions to ensure that only authorized Loan Originators can access sensitive data.

### Authentication Protocol

- **Bearer Token:** The API uses **Bearer Authentication** for all requests.

- **Authorization Key:** Every loan originator is assigned a unique “Authorization Key” provided by the Lendermarket team.

- **Header Format:** This key must be passed in the request header as: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

- **Credential Verification:** Upon receiving a call, the API validates the provided credentials before authorizing the method and returning data.

### IP Whitelisting

To provide an additional layer of security, Lendermarket uses IP-based access control:

- **Static IP Requirement:** Loan originators must call the **API** from a **static IP address**.

- **Whitelisting:** Lendermarket will whitelist this specific IP to prevent unauthorized access from other locations provided during the onboarding process.
