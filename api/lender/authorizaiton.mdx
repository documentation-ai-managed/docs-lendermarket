title: Authorization
---
When the client requires data from Lendermarket, the client will establish a connection to the Lender Loan API by calling the Loan API URL link and passing the user credentials. The Lender Loan API will check the credentials. Every lender will have a unique “Authorization Key” which will be provided by the LM team. So they can use this key to send API requests. Authorization type will be Bearer Token.

Moreover, LM will also check the lender's IP. Lenders should call Loan API from a static IP so LM can whitelist this IP and not change it frequently. (For test environment, there is no IP control)
