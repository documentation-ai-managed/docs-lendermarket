## Two-Factor Authentication Setup

Two-factor authentication (`2FA`) requires a second verification step beyond your password, typically using an authenticator app or SMS codes. This prevents account compromise even if your password is exposed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable 2FA" icon="lock">
    Log in to your Lendermarket dashboard at `https://app.lendermarket.com`.

    Navigate to **Account Settings** > **Security**.

    Click **Enable 2FA**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scan QR Code" icon="smartphone">
    Download an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy.

    Scan the QR code displayed in your dashboard.

    Enter the 6-digit code from the app to verify.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Backup Codes" icon="save">
    Download and store the provided backup codes securely.

    Use these only if you lose access to your authenticator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Test `2FA` during setup by logging out and back in to confirm it works.
